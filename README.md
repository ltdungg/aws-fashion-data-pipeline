# AWS Fashion Data Pipeline

## Overview

AWS Fashion Data Pipeline is a comprehensive data engineering project designed to build a data lake on AWS for an online clothing store. This project integrates data from multiple sources, including Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) and Amazon Kinesis, to create a robust analytics pipeline for fashion product recommendations.

## Project Architecture

The pipeline follows a modern data lake architecture with several key components:

- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Collects data from RDS databases and real-time streams via Kinesis
- **Storage Layer**: Organizes data in Amazon S3 with different zones (landing, raw, curated)
- **Processing Layer**: Transforms data using AWS Glue and Lambda functions
- **Cataloging Layer**: Manages metadata using AWS Glue Data Catalog
- **Consumption Layer**: Enables analytics and recommendation generation
- **Security & Governance Layer**: Implements data protection and access controls

## Key Features

- Integration of batch data from RDS and streaming data from Kinesis
- Serverless architecture using AWS managed services
- ETL processes for data transformation and enrichment
- Product recommendation system based on customer behavior analysis
- Scalable infrastructure that can handle growing data volumes

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **ec2/**: Contains scripts and configurations for EC2 instances
- **glue/**: Includes AWS Glue ETL jobs and workflows
- **lambda/**: Houses Lambda functions for real-time data processing

## Technologies Used

- **Amazon RDS**: For storing structured data like product information and customer profiles
- **Amazon Kinesis**: For capturing real-time user interactions and clickstream data
- **AWS Glue**: For ETL processes and data catalog management
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless computing and real-time data processing
- **Amazon S3**: For data lake storage in various formats
